# DiscO_Sensors

Library developed in order to communicate with the sensors on the DiscO Board composed of DS18B20, BME280 and CCS811, or with the SCD30 sensor.

After retrieving the data, you can integrate theses into to general [SlowControl library](https://cp3-git.irmp.ucl.ac.be/phase2tracker/slowcontrol) which will allow you to publish data trough MQTT Network.
